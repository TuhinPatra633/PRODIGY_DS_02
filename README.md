Exploratory data analysis on Indian IPOs
# EDA Project

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Indian IPOs.

## Data Source:

The analysis is based on data sourced from https://www.moneycontrol.com/.

# Project Overview

In this project, I analyze various aspects of Indian IPOs from 2010 to 2023.

## Key Findings:

1. **Record-breaking IPO Activity in 2021**: Despite the challenging pandemic scenario, 2021 witnessed the highest number of IPOs and surpassed other years in terms of total issue size. This surge suggests that COVID-19 may have incentivized more companies to go public.

2. **Profitability of IPOs**: Out of 358 companies analyzed, 200 reported profits, translating to a profit percentage of 55.87%. This percentage exceeds many other investment avenues, indicating that investing in IPOs presents a higher chance of profit than loss. Further research in IPOs coupled with this profit percentage could enhance investment strategies.

3. **Subscription and Listing Gains**: Companies with a total subscription of 50 or more demonstrate a high probability of positive listing gains, highlighting the importance of subscription metrics in predicting post-listing performance.
